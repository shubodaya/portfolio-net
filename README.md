# Shubodaya Kumar — Network Engineer Portfolio

Live site: https://shubodaya.github.io/portfolio-net/

## Why I built this
I wanted a single-page home that shows how I think about networking—equal parts hands-on, operationally sharp, and visually polished. This site highlights my experience running and supporting networks, the labs I build to stay sharp, and the certifications I keep current.

## What is inside
- **Hero built for network folks**: animated NOC live feed, smooth scroll progress, and quotes from Paul Vixie and Vint Cerf that resonate with my approach.
- **About with live terminal vibe**: quick story of my values, operational metrics (3+ years enterprise support, 25+ field incidents, 20+ KB articles, 3 spot awards), and an interactive router prompt that responds to `enable`/`exit`.
- **Experience timeline**: Itarmi (freelance IT Support Engineer) and SonicWall (Technical Support Engineer) with tags for routing, VPN/SD-WAN, HA, and NOC escalations.
- **Projects gallery**: labs that mirror production—Cisco + EVE-NG builds, Azure cloud network lab with Sentinel, automated log analyzer in Python, WAF/OWASP validation, and more, plus a CTA to my GitHub.
- **Education & certifications**: MSc Cybersecurity (Distinction, Swansea University) and BEng E&C, plus CCNA, Network+, Azure Fundamentals, Security+, (ISC)² CC, and an in-progress CCNP. Includes a small Python-inspired automation snippet for cert status.
- **Skills & interests**: networking-first toolset (routing, monitoring, automation, identity) and a glimpse of the creative and active pursuits that keep me balanced.
- **Contact ready**: location (Plymouth, England, open to relocation), email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub links, and a Web3Forms-powered contact form.

## Tech stack
- React 19 with Vite 7 for a fast, component-driven SPA.
- Vanilla CSS with Space Grotesk + Unica One typography, dark gradient grid background, and intersection-observer reveal animations.
- Deployed to GitHub Pages from the `dist` build.
